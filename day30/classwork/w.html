    <h1>off-road</h1>
<p>Sport bikes are road bikes that emphasize top speed, acceleration, braking, handling and grip,[3][5][25][26] typically at the expense of comfort and fuel economy in comparison to other motorcycle types.[6][9] Sport bikes have comparatively high performance engines supported within a lightweight frame. Inline-four engines dominate the sport bike category, with V-twins and parallel twins having a significant presence; and most other engine configurations appear in small numbers at times.[6] High-performance braking systems may use upgraded brake pads, multi-piston calipers and larger vented rotors.[6] Sports bike suspension systems may be more sophisticated, with greater adjustments for compression and rebound.[6] Sport bikes have fairings to completely enclose the engine, along with windscreens that effectively deflect the air at high speeds away from the rider, thereby minimising overall drag.[6]</p>
