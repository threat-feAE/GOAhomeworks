    <h1><strong>COUNTRIES</strong></h1>
    <p>his is a list of countries and dependencies by population.
 It includes sovereign states, inhabited dependent territories and, in some cases, constituent countries of sovereign states, with inclusion within the list being primarily based on the ISO standard ISO 3166-1.
  For instance, the United Kingdom is considered a single entity, while the constituent countries of the Kingdom of the Netherlands are considered separately. In addition, this list includes certain states with limited recognition not found in ISO 3166-1.
   Also given in a percentage is each country's population compared with the world population, which the United Nations estimated at 8.232 billion as of 2025.
